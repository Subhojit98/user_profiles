## Installation and Setup

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **pnpm** (v8 or higher)

> ⚠️ **Note (Important)**  
> This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.  
> While `npm` may work in some cases, I **strongly recommend** using `pnpm` to ensure consistent dependency resolution, especially with features like workspaces and the lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`).
>
> If you don’t have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally with:
>
> ```bash
> npm install -g pnpm
> ```

### Steps to Run the App
